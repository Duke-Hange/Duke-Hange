## About Me

A master's student in psychology(GPA 3.9/4.0) focusing on cross-frequency coupling, spatiotemporal specificity, and data-driven stimulation strategies. I have extensive experience in multimodal data acquisition (MEG/EEG/fMRI/fNIRS + tDCS) and signal analysis, with some skills in MATLAB, partial Python, and Linux automation scripts.

My research interests include cross-frequency coupling phenomena in the brain, spatial specificity across different frequency bands, and spatiotemporal patterns under different tasks with corresponding precise intervention strategies.
